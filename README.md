# Implementation plan

## Q-learning algorithm

### Executing the Q-learning algorithm

- Implementation: Set up the data structures for the Q-matrix and implement the
following tasks: initialize Q-matrix, select random action, perform random action,
receive reward for action, update Q-matrix, determine when Q-matrix has converged.
These will be implemented in a ROS node making use of the phantom robot node using
the sub/pub messages for determining the outcomes from the learning phase.

- Testing: A self-contained python node will be created to test each of the phases
of the Q-learning algorithm. Through printing states to the screen and running test
cases where the learning updates can be calculated by hand, the functions can be
tested and shown to be correct.

### Determining when the Q-matrix has converged

- Implementation: The convergence of the Q-matrix will be tested by checking the
Frobenius norm of the Q-matrix (sum of the squares of the matrix), or the Frobenius
norm of the change in the Q-matrix from one step to another (sum of the squares
of the delta from one update). Once the Frobenius norm ceases to change, or changes
by less than a threshold, the Q-matrix has converged.

- Testing: A simple loop can be created that changes a matrix by an amount that
decreases over time geometrically. Once the changes are small enough, the convergence
threshold should be met and the convergence can be tested. We can also print a
small subset of Q-matrix values to the screen to observe convergence.

### Choosing actions to maximize reward

- Implementation: Given the state of the world, the Q-matrix will show which
actions are feasible, and which have the highest expected future reward. We can
simply select the one action of highest future reward, or randomly select actions
proportional to their expected future reward. If there are actions of equal future
reward, we can randomly select from among them.

- Testing: Given a Q-matrix, we can test that we select an appropriate action.
We can first do this with the phantom robot movement, and then once the movement
node is created, we can test with the turtlebot.

## Robot perception

### Identifying and locating the colored dumbbells

- Implementation: We can use the color image sensor to detect the direction in
which a given dumbbell lies relative to the robot (the color values should stand
out against those of the world background and the blocks). Then, we can inspect
the values of those contrasting color measurements to determine the identity of
the dumbbell in view.

- Testing: We can use Gazebo to place the robot near specific dumbbells and verify
that the correct direction and color are determined from the image sensor
measurements.

### Identifying and locating the numbered blocks

- Implementation: We can use a similar technique to that described above for
the dumbbells, though instead of image sensor measurements, we will instead use
an opencv2 classifier (as demonstrated in the class 11 lecture notes) for detecting
the numbers on the blocks.

- Testing: As was true of the implementation, testing should also be similar to
that described for identifying and locating the dumbbells.

## Robot manipulation and movement

### Handling the dumbbells with the OpenMANIPULATOR arm

- Implementation: We will use the provided routines to command the manipulator
arm to the required angles to grip the dumbbells, and then to close the claw,
and then to lift the dumbbells. These required positions will be fixed since the
dumbbells are the same size and do not change. If the orientation of the robot
needs to be set properly in order to grab the dumbbells, we will implement a
proportional feedback routine to position the dumbbell in the center of the camera
so that it can be grabbed. The parameters of the positioning algorithm will need
to be learned from trial and error in Gazebo.

- Testing: Using Gazebo, we will place the dumbbells in front of the robot and
determine the necessary angles to command in order to address, grab, and lift the
dumbbells. We can similarly set up the dumbbells in front of the robot to test the
tracking algorithm to position the robot in place so that it can grab the dumbbells.


### Navigating to where the robot will handle the dumbbells

- Implementation: We can use the laser scanner and color image sensor to determine
the location of the dumbbells in the world, and either determine the color of the
dumbbell at a distance (we can test this) or move to that location and use the
color sensor to determine which dumbbell is at that location. Once the dumbbell
locations are known, we can use the Q-matrix to determine where to place them
using the manipulator functions from above.

- Testing: Using our movement framework, instruct the robot to navigate to a
specific dumbbell or block, and visually inspect the results. It should be clear
if something is amiss (e.g. navigating to an incorrect target, missing the target
entirely, colliding with the target, etc).
