# Q-Learning Project

## Implementation Plan

Team Member: Katie Hughes

* Executing the Q-Learning Algorithm
* Determining when the Q-Matrix has converged
* Once the Q-Matrix has converged, how to determine which actions the robot should take to maximize expected reward
* Determining identities and locations of the 3 colored dumbells
* Determining identities and locations to the 3 numbered blocks
* Picking up and putting down the dumbbells with the OpenManipulator arm
* Navigating to the appropriate locations to pick up and put down the dumbbells

## Timeline
I will try to complete these items in the order/grouping they are listed as. My first goal is to implement the Q-learning algorithm and fill in the Q-matrix. I hope to complete this by the end of this week (around Feb 20). Afterwards, I will try to implement the robot perception category items. I plan to complete this by mid-next week (around Feb 23/24). Finally I will work on the robot manipulation items, which I hope to complete by the end of next week (Feb 26/27) which will give me a few days to debug before the project is due.
